# Project Name: Hustle
### Team Name: Accountabilibuddy
Team members: Kyle, Luay, Eve

##### Code Fellows iOS project in Swift 3

#### Project Concept: An application that helps students manage their job search after graduation. Assist with personal accountability to handle tasks, leads, planning and networking.

#### Libraries and Frameworks
1) BEMCheckBox is the library used for the the checkboxes
2) CloudKit is the database framework used to store data

Problem Domain: A lot of students decide to take some time off after they graduate, which results in losing the skills they built and the inability to land a job. Our Application aims to track their daily progress based on 3 facors: Job Search, Technical Skills, and Networking. There will be a daily task with multiple selections the user can pick from. Then, they can present their progress over one month timeframe and hopefully get a job! Otherwise, they can show their progress history to someone who can help pointing out some un-accomplished tasks and lead them to the right path, then start the one-month cycle over again.

### About the Team
- Kyle Hillman: I grew up in Olympia, WA and spent five years serving in the Army.  After leaving the service I finished my bachelor's degree in Audio production.  Towards the end of my degree, I found myself spending more time writing code than working on my degree.  After graduating I found Code Fellows and it has been a whirlwind of a ride ever since.
- Eve Denison:  Iâ€™m a native New Mexican and have spent most of my life in the Southwest, but I fell in love with the PNW! I have ten years of experience in the mental health field spent mostly as a clinical social worker. I have a background in interdisciplinary arts as well. I am excited to eventually use technology to help people with mental health issues.
- Luay Younus: I am a world traveller enjoying the west-coast with it's technology scene. I finished my bachelor's degree in Computer telecommunications Engineering. Worked in several fields as well as a Network engineer. I enjoy solving problems in different ways and have a passion for UX. Building this application allowed me to be an effective team player and elevated my motivation to build more apps!
