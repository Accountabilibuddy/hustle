# Project Name: Hustle
### Team Name: Accountabilibuddy
Team members: Kyle, Luay, Eve

Code Fellows iOS project in Swift 3

#### Project Concept: An application that helps students manage their job search after graduation. Assist with personal accountability to handle tasks, leads, planning and networking.

#### Libraris and Frameworks
1) BEMCheckBox is the library used for the the checkboxes
2) CloudKit

Problem Domain: A lot of students decide to take some time off after they graduate, which results in losing the skills they built and inability to land a job. Our Application aims to track their daily progress based on 3 facors: Job Search, Meeting Technical Skills, and Networking. There will be a daily task with multiple selections the user can pick from. After that, they can present their progress over one month and hopefully get a job! If not, they can show their progress to someone who can help pointing out some un-accomplished tasks and lead them to the right path, then start the one-month cycle over again.
